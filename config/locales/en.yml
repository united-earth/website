# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:

#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:

      what:
        header: 'What is United Earth?'
        content1: 'United Earth serves to promote and facilitate a globally co-created cultural transition by providing an open, inclusive and egalitarian meeting space for all life-affirming persons and groups to unite and collaborate.'
        content2: "United Earth is basically a 'universal docking-station' for both individuals and groups where we can all share and discover our diverse wealth of knowledge, ideas, visions, skills, tools, technologies, resources and transition strategies on one common platform. Here we can focus our collective intelligence and cooperative actions towards a peaceful, free, just and healthy world for everyone."
      why:
        header: 'Why do we need global unity and collaboration?'
        content1: 'Humanity urgently needs a new story to effectively address the mutiple crises we are facing such as climate change, ecological destruction, war, economic inequality, etc. Today there is a rapidly growing understanding that all these adversities are inherently interconnected, and that they are all symptoms of political and economic systems which are disconnected from the welfare of humanity and our home.'
        content2: "The untold empowering and uplifting news is that we already have the ecological solutions, social innovations, alternative political and economic models, and the living examples to solve the world's problems. NOW is the time to realise that the change we seek is entirely in our hands - when we join them together. We are One Human Family, regardless of religion, race, ideology, or political borders. As a unified global collaborative, we can inspire and bring about monumental change to the planet."
      how:
        header: 'How: An Open-invitation for Co-creation'
        content1: "Inviting planetary unity and collaboration has to be the most ambitious collective endeavour in human history. And clearly this would not be imaginable without today's widespread availability and accessibility of the Internet. The fact that most people and all groups working for a brighter future are connected to the Internet means that we now have a powerful opportunity to come together for this common cause and vision."
        content2: 'In light of the magnitude of this vision, we foresee the snowballing of global unity beginning with people and groups who a) recognise the potential and possibilities of our intentional unification, and b) are willing and able to put aside ideological differences for the greater good of all.'
        content3: "A unified global collaboration at this scale will inevitably attract worldwide mainstream attention to the wealth of existing alternative models and possibilities that are ignored by the corporate media. By openly inviting cooperation with the mainstream we affirm that United Earth is an inclusive responsibility to be realised and enjoyed together."
        content4: "At this stage in the development of United Earth, we are building the platform where we can gather our global community of members and collaborators. As we grow together, so too will the tools and features of this website."

    gathering:
      title: 'The Global Transition Gathering'
      subtitle: '- A United Earth Ceremony & Celebration'
      intro:
        header: 'Introduction'
        content1: 'The Global Transition Gathering (GTG) is an unprecedented event designed to promote planetary unity, healing, cooperation and solutions-awareness. The first GTG will take place at the same time as the COP21 - the UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties - and the COM21 - the Conference of the Movements - in Paris on December 5th & 6th, 2015.'
        content2: 'Essentially The Global Transition Gathering is the "planetary extension” of the COM21- with the broader vision of globally promoting whole-systems transformation and building local, collaborative connections among the movements. The invitation is for all UE allies to independently organise events that reflect their particular interest and passion, e.g. tree planting, festival, meditation, prayer, water ceremony, etc. Each group will register their event on the United Earth website so others can easily connect on the local level.'
      proposal:
        header: 'Program proposal'
        content1: '<b>Saturday, December 5th</b> is dedicated to healing the past - especially towards women and the First Peoples - by way of a Global Truth, Reconciliation and Forgiveness Ceremony. We believe that for humanity to move into a new paradigm of sharing and cooperation we must first collectively bring the reconciliation and healing of our past actions and violations into light. This "Global Medicine Wheel” will be co-created by voluntary groups around the world. Furthermore there will be special events facilitated with the guidance of indigenous and spiritual leaders and Elders to be held at sacred sites on all the continents. To complete this momentous ceremony we intend to collectively channel this powerful and transformative energy of forgiveness and healing into a unified prayer and intention for the restoration of Mother Earth.'
        content2: '<b>Sunday, December 6th</b> is dedicated to celebrating our collective intention to work together to heal our Mother Earth - and to help bring awareness of alternative solutions to the forefront of mainstream attention. To promote a whole-systems transformation, we are inviting an infinitely creative, synchronised celebration through music, art, community, Earth restoration, etc. The only criterion is our collective intention to unite, cooperate and co-create a peaceful, free, just and abundant Earth for all, now and in the future.'
        content3: 'YES, this will be the biggest conscious and unified gathering the world has ever seen!'

      title: 'CONFERENCE OF THE MOVEMENTS 5-6 DECEMBER 2015'
      content:
        1: "From 30 November to 11 December 2015, a crucial turning point in the history of mankind will take place. It will be the 21st Conference of Parties (COP21) of the UNFCCC and the 11th meeting of the Parties of the Kyoto Protocol. See link below."
        2: "At this summit, all countries will be pursuing the goal of limiting the global temperature increase to 2ºC. However the IPCC's latest report mentions about 4-5 ºC, with cataclysmic consequences. So whatever the outcome of the goal of 2 ºC will be, it just still isn't enough to turn the tide. Even assuming that they will achieve this goal: in practice, most likely a less result will be the net outcome. For this reason we are organizing a conference where all movements unite as ONE to present powerful alternative ideas to the current developments which the consuming-system is bringing us."
        3: "In order to \"send a message\" and express our opinions our plan is to unite all these groups and give alternate solutions to the status quo to really make something happen and to create the reality we're all working towards, helping to get beyond the status quo."
        4: "We believe that we have to co-operate to make sure our message is clear: WE WANT A LIVEABLE PLANET FOR ALL with a system based on freedom and equality."

      title: 'The United Earth Application for the UN Solutions Summit on September 27, 2015'
      intro: 'On August 29th, 2015, United Earth submitted the following application for the UN Solutions Summit. We are sharing it with you to provide a deeper insight into the values, purpose and vision of our, and your United Earth. Furthermore, this application serves as a testimony to:'
      list:
        a: 'our commitment to promoting global unity and collaboration for a whole-systems transformation of human society.'
        b: 'our dedication to bring our wealth of existing practical solutions and alternative models to the forefront of public awareness.'
        c: 'our willingness to work with existing political bodies.'
        d: 'our integrity, by not compromising our values and objectives when dealing with existing political bodies.'
        e: 'the fact that the current political structures fail to recognise:'
      sublist:
        a: 'the systemic causes of our ecological and cultural degradation.'
        b: "that we already have the solutions to solve the world's problems."
        c: 'that the Sustainable Development Goals set out in the Solutions Summit are not separate, but inherently interconnected.'
        d: 'support or implement <i>whole-systems</i> solutions that prioritise the welfare of The People and The Earth.'

      pre-question: 'The final question in the application was this:'
      final-question: 'Share with us your motivation(s) for applying to be a part of the inaugural Solutions Summit.'
      motivation: "The motivation of a United Earth to be participating in the inaugural Solutions Summit is twofold:"
      motivation-block1: "1. To highlight the fact, both to the people at the summit and to the world at large, that we already have a vast wealth of tried-and-tested solutions for all the problems humanity is facing. For the welfare of humankind and our planetary home it is vital that we recognise the fact that the crises we are facing are not for a lack of solutions and alternatives, but for a lack of political will and capacity to implement them."
      motivation-block2: "2. We are here to take advantage of this Solutions Summit, at the world's most recognised international political platform, to invite all governments, organisations, representatives - and especially The People they represent - to unite and collaborate for a whole-systems, solutions-based transformation."
      closing-block1: 'In one of the closing remarks we requested that <b>"since this application is submitted in the interest of all concerned and peace-loving citizens of Earth, should you decide to refuse it, we ask that you extend the courtesy of giving us the reason(s) why?”</b>'
      closing-block2: "The fact that this application was rejected comes as no surprise. No reason for refusal was provided. One wonders if they even read it since the speakers at the summit were the same groups that have been presenting at the UN for over a decade - some of whom didn't even apply!"
      closing-block3: "Clearly this affirms that we, The People, cannot continue to look to politicians to take the urgent, informed and wise actions necessary - not only to prevent impending ecological, economic and social collapses - but to create a harmonious and healthy world for all people and our future generations to enjoy."

      content: 'Most social and ecological innovators will agree that the most fundamental criterion for all our political, social and economic reform is re-localisation. This means bringing governance & decision-making, livelihoods & businesses, food & energy production, water, waste & biodiversity management back to a locally directed and a bio-regionally sustainable level. Through these practical collective efforts, as exemplified by the Transition Town movement, we can build vibrant local economies and resilient communities.'

      quote1: 'The few who understand the system will either be so interested in its profits or be so dependent upon its favours that there will be no opposition from that class, while on the other hand, the great body of people, mentally incapable of comprehending the tremendous advantage that capital derives from the system, will bear its burdens without complaint, and perhaps without even suspecting that the system is inimical to their interests.'
      author1: '- The Rothschild brothers of London writing to associates in New York, 1863.'
      content1: 'To effectively design and implement solutions we must first understand the nature and root cause of our problems. Today there can be little doubt that human society at large is completely ruled by money. The vast majority of people spend most of their time, energy and intelligence thinking or worrying about how to acquire, accumulate or spend money. Money itself is not the problem. Only when we understand that the fractional reserve banking system is designed to impose and maintain a paradigm of scarcity and inequality, can we begin to comprehend the extent to which it impacts all other aspects of human society - with all its resulting ramifications, i.e. greed, violence, poverty, etc. '
      quote2: 'There is without a doubt a mega-crisis that we are facing in the coming years. And the big elephant in the living room is the money problem. Unfortunately most people who are active in the sustainability movement and the environmental movement don’t understand the nature of this problem. We are not going to make any significant headway with sustainability or restoration of the environment until we solve the money problem.'

      content3: 'United Earth, along with numerous New Economy groups, invites humanity into a new paradigm of economic equality, Universal Basic Income, circular economies, moneyless exchanges, sharing and gifting. We have the economic models to create a responsible abundance for everyone: a world where everyone’s basic rights - healthy food, clean water, comfortable shelter and renewable energy - are easily met; a world where all people can fully develop and express their unique talents and creativity, free from any financial concerns. To co-create this world we need to collectively choose it.'
      content4: 'United Earth is co-creating a global platform where we can all express this choice.'
      content5: 'Living in a moneyless community or town will soon become a matter of choice for each of us. During the transition, however, there are numerous available tools such as cryptocurrencies, mutual credit unions, community exchange systems that we can communally choose from.'

      content: "Within the global movements of ecological stewardship, social innovations and indigenous knowledge systems there is a common understanding that we already have an abundant wealth of practical solutions to solve most of the world's problems. Seeing how this vital information is not finding its rightful place in the commercial media, this Solutions Portal will become a significant branch of the United Earth platform by providing a planetary overview and directory of all the best practices, guidance and tools for ecologically- and socially-responsible living."
      quote: "We have the knowledge and technology to provide for all and to reduce our impacts on the environment.
