# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.

        header: 'What is United Earth?'
        content1: 'United Earth serves to promote and facilitate a whole-systems transformation of human society by providing an open, inclusive and egalitarian meeting space for all life-affirming persons and groups to unite and collaborate.'
        content2: 'United Earth is basically a “universal docking-station” for individuals, groups and communities; for us to share our diverse knowledge, ideas, visions, solutions, skills, tools, technologies, resources and transition strategies on one common platform and focus our collective intelligence and actions to co-create a peaceful, free, just and healthy world for everyone.'
      why:
        header: 'Why do we need global unity and collaboration?'
        content1: 'Humanity urgently needs a new story to effectively address the multiple crises we are facing such as climate change, ecological destruction, war, economic inequality, etc. Today there is a rapidly growing understanding that all these adversities are inherently interconnected, and that they are essentially symptomatic manifestations of political and economic systems that have forsaken the welfare of The People and our planetary home.'
        content2: 'The untold empowering and uplifting news is that we already have the ecological solutions, social innovations, alternative political and economic models, and the living examples to solve the World’s problems. NOW is the time to realise that the change we seek is entirely in our hands - when we join them together. We are One Human Family, regardless of religion, race, ideology, or political borders. As a global collaborative, we can inspire and bring about monumental change to the planet.'
      how:
        header: 'How: An Open-invitation for Co-creation'
        content1: 'Inviting planetary unity and collaboration has to be the most ambitious collective endeavour in human history. And clearly this would not be imaginable without today’s widespread availability and accessibility of the Internet. The fact that most people and all groups working for a brighter future are connected to the Internet means there is a powerful opportunity for us to come together for a common cause and vision now.'
        content2: 'Due to the magnitude of this vision, we foresee this snowball of global unity beginning with people and groups who a) recognise the potential and possibilities of our intentional unification, and b) are willing and able to put aside our ideological differences for the greater good of all.'
        content3: 'Unified collaboration at the scale United Earth is inviting will undoubtedly attract global mainstream attention to the wealth of existing intelligent and alternative models and solutions so we can create the more beautiful and abundant world we know is possible. Ultimately, unity and our collective Global Transition is a choice that every one of us needs to make.'

    gathering:
      title: 'The Global Transition Gathering'
      subtitle: '- A United Earth Ceremony & Celebration'
      intro:
        header: 'Introduction'
        content1: 'The Global Transition Gathering (GTG) is an unprecedented event designed to promote planetary unity, healing, cooperation and solutions-awareness. The first GTG will take place at the same time as the COP21 - the UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties - and the COM21 - the Conference of the Movements - in Paris on December 5th & 6th, 2015.'
        content2: 'Essentially The Global Transition Gathering is the “planetary extension” of the COM21- with the broader vision of globally promoting whole-systems transformation and building local, collaborative connections among the movements. The invitation is for all UE allies to independently organise events that reflect their particular interest and passion, e.g. tree planting, festival, meditation, prayer, water ceremony, etc. Each group will register their event on the United Earth website so others can easily connect on the local level.'
      proposal:
        header: 'Program proposal'
        content1: '<b>Saturday, December 5th</b> is dedicated to healing the past - especially towards women and the First Peoples - by way of a Global Truth, Reconciliation and Forgiveness Ceremony. We believe that for humanity to move into a new paradigm of sharing and cooperation we must first collectively bring the reconciliation and healing of our past actions and violations into light. This “Global Medicine Wheel” will be co-created by voluntary groups around the world. Furthermore there will be special events facilitated with the guidance of indigenous and spiritual leaders and Elders to be held at sacred sites on all the continents. To complete this momentous ceremony we intend to collectively channel this powerful and transformative energy of forgiveness and healing into a unified prayer and intention for the restoration of Mother Earth.'
        content2: '<b>Sunday, December 6th</b> is dedicated to celebrating our collective intention to work together to heal our Mother Earth - and to help bring awareness of alternative solutions to the forefront of mainstream attention. To promote a whole-systems transformation, we are inviting an infinitely creative, synchronised celebration through music, art, community, Earth restoration, etc. The only criterion is our collective intention to unite, cooperate and co-create a peaceful, free, just and abundant Earth for all, now and in the future.'

      title: 'CONFERENCE OF THE MOVEMENTS 5-6 DECEMBER 2015'
      content:
        1: "From 30 November to 11 December 2015, a crucial turning point in the history of mankind will take place. It will be the 21st Conference of Parties (COP21) of the UNFCCC and the 11th meeting of the Parties of the Kyoto Protocol. See link below."
        2: "At this summit, all countries will be pursuing the goal of limiting the global temperature increase to 2ºC. However the IPCC’s latest report mentions about 4-5 ºC, with cataclysmic consequences. So whatever the outcome of the goal of 2 ºC will be, it just still isn't enough to turn the tide. Even assuming that they will achieve this goal: in practice, most likely a less result will be the net outcome. For this reason we are organizing a conference where all movements unite as ONE to present powerful alternative ideas to the current developments which the consuming-system is bringing us."
        3: "In order to \"send a message\" and express our opinions our plan is to unite all these groups and give alternate solutions to the status quo to really make something happen and to create the reality we're all working towards, helping to get beyond the status quo."
        4: "We believe that we have to co-operate to make sure our message is clear: WE WANT A LIVEABLE PLANET FOR ALL with a system based on freedom and equality."

      intro: 'On August 29th, 2015, United Earth submitted the following application for the UN Solutions Summit. We are sharing it with you to provide a deeper insight into the values, purpose and vision of our, and your United Earth. Furthermore, this application serves as a testimony to:'
      list:
        a: 'our commitment to promoting global unity and collaboration for a whole-systems transformation of human society.'
        b: 'our dedication to bring our wealth of existing practical solutions and alternative models to the forefront of public awareness.'
        c: 'our willingness to work with existing political bodies.'
        d: 'our integrity, by not compromising our values and objectives when dealing with existing political bodies.'
        e: 'the fact that the current political structures fail to recognise:'
      sublist:
        a: 'the systemic causes of our ecological and cultural degradation.'
        b: 'that we already have the solutions to solve the world’s problems.'
        c: 'that the Sustainable Development Goals set out in the Solutions Summit are not separate, but inherently interconnected.'
        d: 'support or implement <i>whole-systems</i> solutions that prioritise the welfare of The People and The Earth.'

      pre-question: 'The final question in the application was this:'
      final-question: 'Share with us your motivation(s) for applying to be a part of the inaugural Solutions Summit.'
      motivation: "The motivation of a United Earth to be participating in the inaugural Solutions Summit is twofold:"
      motivation-block1: "1. To highlight the fact, both to the people at the summit and to the world at large, that we already have a vast wealth of tried-and-tested solutions for all the problems humanity is facing. For the welfare of humankind and our planetary home it is vital that we recognise the fact that the crises we are facing are not for a lack of solutions and alternatives, but for a lack of political will and capacity to implement them."
      motivation-block2: "2. We are here to take advantage of this Solutions Summit, at the world's most recognised international political platform, to invite all governments, organisations, representatives - and especially The People they represent - to unite and collaborate for a whole-systems, solutions-based transformation."
      closing-block1: "In one of the closing remarks we requested that <b>“since this application is submitted in the interest of all concerned and peace-loving citizens of Earth, should you decide to refuse it, we ask that you extend the courtesy of giving us the reason(s) why?”</b>"
      closing-block2: "The fact that this application was rejected comes as no surprise. No reason for refusal was provided. One wonders if they even read it since the speakers at the summit were the same groups that have been presenting at the UN for over a decade - some of whom didn’t even apply!"
      closing-block3: "Clearly this affirms that we, The People, cannot continue to look to politicians to take the urgent, informed and wise actions necessary - not only to prevent impending ecological, economic and social collapses - but to create a harmonious and healthy world for all people and our future generations to enjoy."
