# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

        header: 'What is United Earth?'
        content1: 'United Earth serves to promote and facilitate a whole-systems transformation of human society by providing an open, inclusive and egalitarian meeting space for all life-affirming persons and groups to unite and collaborate.'
        content2: 'United Earth is basically a “universal docking-station” for individuals, groups and communities; for us to share our diverse knowledge, ideas, visions, solutions, skills, tools, technologies, resources and transition strategies on one common platform and focus our collective intelligence and actions to co-create a peaceful, free, just and healthy world for everyone.'
      why:
        header: 'Why do we need global unity and collaboration?'
        content1: 'Humanity urgently needs a new story to effectively address the multiple crises we are facing such as climate change, ecological destruction, war, economic inequality, etc. Today there is a rapidly growing understanding that all these adversities are inherently interconnected, and that they are essentially symptomatic manifestations of political and economic systems that have forsaken the welfare of The People and our planetary home.'
        content2: 'The untold empowering and uplifting news is that we already have the ecological solutions, social innovations, alternative political and economic models, and the living examples to solve the World’s problems. NOW is the time to realise that the change we seek is entirely in our hands - when we join them together. We are One Human Family, regardless of religion, race, ideology, or political borders. As a global collaborative, we can inspire and bring about monumental change to the planet.'
      how:
        header: 'How: An Open-invitation for Co-creation'
        content1: 'Inviting planetary unity and collaboration has to be the most ambitious collective endeavour in human history. And clearly this would not be imaginable without today’s widespread availability and accessibility of the Internet. The fact that most people and all groups working for a brighter future are connected to the Internet means there is a powerful opportunity for us to come together for a common cause and vision now.'
        content2: 'Due to the magnitude of this vision, we foresee this snowball of global unity beginning with people and groups who a) recognise the potential and possibilities of our intentional unification, and b) are willing and able to put aside our ideological differences for the greater good of all.'
        content3: 'Unified collaboration at the scale United Earth is inviting will undoubtedly attract global mainstream attention to the wealth of existing intelligent and alternative models and solutions so we can create the more beautiful and abundant world we know is possible. Ultimately, unity and our collective Global Transition is a choice that every one of us needs to make.'
