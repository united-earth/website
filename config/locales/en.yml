# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.

        header: 'What is United Earth?'
        content1: 'United Earth serves to promote and facilitate a whole-systems transformation of human society by providing an open, inclusive and egalitarian meeting space for all life-affirming persons and groups to unite and collaborate.'
        content2: 'United Earth is basically a “universal docking-station” for individuals, groups and communities; for us to share our diverse knowledge, ideas, visions, solutions, skills, tools, technologies, resources and transition strategies on one common platform and focus our collective intelligence and actions to co-create a peaceful, free, just and healthy world for everyone.'
      why:
        header: 'Why do we need global unity and collaboration?'
        content1: 'Humanity urgently needs a new story to effectively address the multiple crises we are facing such as climate change, ecological destruction, war, economic inequality, etc. Today there is a rapidly growing understanding that all these adversities are inherently interconnected, and that they are essentially symptomatic manifestations of political and economic systems that have forsaken the welfare of The People and our planetary home.'
        content2: 'The untold empowering and uplifting news is that we already have the ecological solutions, social innovations, alternative political and economic models, and the living examples to solve the World’s problems. NOW is the time to realise that the change we seek is entirely in our hands - when we join them together. We are One Human Family, regardless of religion, race, ideology, or political borders. As a global collaborative, we can inspire and bring about monumental change to the planet.'
      how:
        header: 'How: An Open-invitation for Co-creation'
        content1: 'Inviting planetary unity and collaboration has to be the most ambitious collective endeavour in human history. And clearly this would not be imaginable without today’s widespread availability and accessibility of the Internet. The fact that most people and all groups working for a brighter future are connected to the Internet means there is a powerful opportunity for us to come together for a common cause and vision now.'
        content2: 'Due to the magnitude of this vision, we foresee this snowball of global unity beginning with people and groups who a) recognise the potential and possibilities of our intentional unification, and b) are willing and able to put aside our ideological differences for the greater good of all.'
        content3: 'Unified collaboration at the scale United Earth is inviting will undoubtedly attract global mainstream attention to the wealth of existing intelligent and alternative models and solutions so we can create the more beautiful and abundant world we know is possible. Ultimately, unity and our collective Global Transition is a choice that every one of us needs to make.'

    gathering:
      title: 'The Global Transition Gathering'
      subtitle: '- A United Earth Ceremony & Celebration'
      intro:
        header: 'Introduction'
        content1: 'The Global Transition Gathering (GTG) is an unprecedented event designed to promote planetary unity, healing, cooperation and solutions-awareness. The first GTG will take place at the same time as the COP21 - the UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties - and the COM21 - the Conference of the Movements - in Paris on December 5th & 6th, 2015.'
        content2: 'Essentially The Global Transition Gathering is the “planetary extension” of the COM21- with the broader vision of globally promoting whole-systems transformation and building local, collaborative connections among the movements. The invitation is for all UE allies to independently organise events that reflect their particular interest and passion, e.g. tree planting, festival, meditation, prayer, water ceremony, etc. Each group will register their event on the United Earth website so others can easily connect on the local level.'
      proposal:
        header: 'Program proposal'
        content1: '<b>Saturday, December 5th</b> is dedicated to healing the past - especially towards women and the First Peoples - by way of a Global Truth, Reconciliation and Forgiveness Ceremony. We believe that for humanity to move into a new paradigm of sharing and cooperation we must first collectively bring the reconciliation and healing of our past actions and violations into light. This “Global Medicine Wheel” will be co-created by voluntary groups around the world. Furthermore there will be special events facilitated with the guidance of indigenous and spiritual leaders and Elders to be held at sacred sites on all the continents. To complete this momentous ceremony we intend to collectively channel this powerful and transformative energy of forgiveness and healing into a unified prayer and intention for the restoration of Mother Earth.'
        content2: '<b>Sunday, December 6th</b> is dedicated to celebrating our collective intention to work together to heal our Mother Earth - and to help bring awareness of alternative solutions to the forefront of mainstream attention. To promote a whole-systems transformation, we are inviting an infinitely creative, synchronised celebration through music, art, community, Earth restoration, etc. The only criterion is our collective intention to unite, cooperate and co-create a peaceful, free, just and abundant Earth for all, now and in the future.'
        content3: 'YES, this will be the biggest conscious and unified gathering the world has ever seen!'

      title: 'CONFERENCE OF THE MOVEMENTS 5-6 DECEMBER 2015'
      content:
        1: "From 30 November to 11 December 2015, a crucial turning point in the history of mankind will take place. It will be the 21st Conference of Parties (COP21) of the UNFCCC and the 11th meeting of the Parties of the Kyoto Protocol. See link below."
        2: "At this summit, all countries will be pursuing the goal of limiting the global temperature increase to 2ºC. However the IPCC’s latest report mentions about 4-5 ºC, with cataclysmic consequences. So whatever the outcome of the goal of 2 ºC will be, it just still isn't enough to turn the tide. Even assuming that they will achieve this goal: in practice, most likely a less result will be the net outcome. For this reason we are organizing a conference where all movements unite as ONE to present powerful alternative ideas to the current developments which the consuming-system is bringing us."
        3: "In order to \"send a message\" and express our opinions our plan is to unite all these groups and give alternate solutions to the status quo to really make something happen and to create the reality we're all working towards, helping to get beyond the status quo."
        4: "We believe that we have to co-operate to make sure our message is clear: WE WANT A LIVEABLE PLANET FOR ALL with a system based on freedom and equality."
